# My-Self-Hosted-Life

This project started has a way to learn more about opensource, web apps, linux and docker.

The more I learned the more I realized that I should own my own data and that I was giving companies a lot of my personal information without my knowledge.

This is my effort to self host everything I use on a daily basis. 

It uses docker and docker compose for the moment but I might learn and create some playbooks with Ansible later.

### Key Goals
